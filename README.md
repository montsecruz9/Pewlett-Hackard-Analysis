## Summary:
- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

The number of job positions that will need to be filled is 72,458. 

- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

The number of retirement-ready employees who could mentor the next generation of employees is 1549. The mentorship program is directed to those employees born in 1965. This doesn't seem to be enough for all the 72,458 new employees. 

If we change the criteria into having those retirement-ready employees born between 1964 and 1965 in the program, the number of retirement-ready employees that would be eligible for mentoring increases to 19,905. Each employee will be able to mentor a team of 3 or 4 new employees.
